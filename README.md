## LEVELS  
## 1. I‚Äôm Really a Cat  
(Concept Map: Volcano / Underworld)  

Time of Day: Unknown (as it is in the underworld).
  
Story:  
After awakening in the spirit realm, the little cat finds itself in the underworld, surrounded by rocky terrain and molten lava. Terrified, the cat trembles, but isn‚Äôt jumping and running a cat‚Äôs natural skill?
Setting fear aside, the cat decides to move forward, overcoming obstacles to climb the pillar that leads back to the surface.

Mechanics:  
The player must complete three challenges:
  
Jump across floating rock platforms.  
Run along a winding path.  
Climb the pillar to reach the goal.  
The player controls the cat to overcome these obstacles while avoiding hazards. If the player falls into the lava or collides with an object, the character is considered "dead," and the level must be restarted.  
  
Music: Dark and intense.  

## 2. Purr-fect Escape  
(Concept Map: Farm / Surface World)

Time of Day: Morning.  

Story:  
After escaping from the underworld, the little cat finds itself on the surface. However, before it can celebrate, it realizes it is trapped inside a maze with complex pathways. This time, the cat must navigate the maze and find a way out.

Mechanics:  

The player explores the maze, searching for the exit.  
Small details will help the player remember which paths they have already taken.  
Upon escaping the maze, the player guides the cat to a house, leading to the next stage‚Äîheaven.  
Music: Cheerful and lighthearted.  
  
## 3. Heavenly Paws  
(Concept Map: Floating Island / Heaven)  

Time of Day: Morning.  

Story:  
After entering the house in the previous level, the cat is transported to a floating island. Looking back, there is no way to return. The only option is to move forward to avoid being stranded in this unknown place.  

Mechanics:  
The player must overcome three challenges:  

Jump across moving floating bricks.  
Successfully land on a moving conveyor belt.  
Navigate through moving pillars (which can disorient and push the player slightly‚Äîif not careful, they may fall).  
The player must guide the cat through these challenges to reach the goal. If the character falls off any surface, the level must be restarted.  

Music: Dreamy and soothing.
